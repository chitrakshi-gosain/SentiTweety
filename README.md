...More steps to be added as we progress towards MVP...

A few potentials for the future:
- User input feature – can we do this to prepare for Expo Night?
- Scale and automate to obtain a greater number of Tweets
- Cloud migration and relevant technologies – this can be a discussion for during the Expo Night
